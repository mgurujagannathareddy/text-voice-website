# Text-to-Speech Web Application 🎙️

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **Text-to-Speech (TTS) web application** that converts user-entered text into audible speech using modern browser capabilities.  
It demonstrates how **AI-assisted browser APIs** can be used to enhance human–computer interaction without requiring backend servers or external libraries.

The application is built as a **single webpage** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

---

## 🎯 Objective
The main objective of this project is to:
- Convert textual input into speech
- Provide user controls for speech customization
- Demonstrate the practical use of browser-based AI features

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **HTML** – Structure of the webpage  
- **CSS** – Styling and layout  
- **JavaScript** – Logic and interactivity  

### API
- **Web Speech API (SpeechSynthesis)**  
  - Built into modern web browsers  
  - Used for converting text into speech  

### Tools
- Web Browser (Chrome / Edge / Firefox)
- Code Editor (VS Code or similar)
- Git & GitHub

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Used
- Document Object Model (DOM)
- Event handling in JavaScript
- Browser-based speech synthesis
- UI controls (sliders and dropdowns)

## ⚙️ Functional Modules

### 1. Text Input Module
- Allows users to enter text
- Uses a `<textarea>` element
- JavaScript reads the input dynamically

---

### 2. Speech Rate Control
- Allows users to control speech speed
- Implemented using a slider (`input type="range"`)
- Uses `speech.rate` property

---

### 3. Pitch Control
- Allows users to adjust voice pitch
- Makes speech sound more natural
- Uses `speech.pitch` property

---

### 4. Voice Selection
- Displays available system voices
- Supports different accents and languages
- Uses `speechSynthesis.getVoices()`

---

### 5. Text-to-Speech Engine
- Converts text into audible speech
- Uses `SpeechSynthesisUtterance`
- Speech output plays through system speakers

---

## 🔄 Working Principle

1. User enters text into the text area
2. User selects:
   - Speech rate
   - Pitch
   - Voice
3. User clicks the **Speak** button
4. JavaScript creates a speech object
5. Browser converts text into audio and plays it

## 🧪 Input & Output

### Input
- Text entered by the user
- Rate, pitch, and voice selection

### Output
- Audible speech generated by the browser

## 🌍 Applications
- Accessibility tools for visually impaired users
- E-learning and reading assistants
- Voice-based user interfaces
- Assistive technologies

---

## ✅ Advantages
- Simple and lightweight
- No backend required
- Real-time speech output
- Uses built-in browser features
- Beginner-friendly implementation

---

## ⚠️ Limitations
- Voice availability depends on browser and OS
- Requires audio output device
- Internet may be required to load some voices

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- Add pause, resume, and stop controls
- Language-based voice filtering
- Save speech as audio file
- Integrate Speech-to-Text functionality
